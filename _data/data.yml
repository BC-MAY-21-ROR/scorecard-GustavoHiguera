  summary: |
    My name is Jorge Rodriguez I live in Colima, Colima Mexico.

    I graduated From Universidad de Colima with a Bachelor's degree in software engineering.

    I mainly focus on web development with React framework and in the backend with Ruby on Rails but I am willing to learn new technologies if require.

    My main focus right now is to get into the industry as a trainee or junior software engineer and start getting experience working in a company.

    Last but not least, I also like all the environment around the GNU/Linux stuff; the distros, commands, terminal, scripting, etc. And hopefully in the future also become a DevOps engineer, but first things firsts.

      I was part of a training group in which the first 2 months we learn the ruby programming language through exercises and programming challenges.
      In the remaining 2 months we developed an MVP(Minimal Valuable Product) which consists of two parts:
      - The first one was focused on the Backend in which we build an API that sends data through JSON and all the related Backend stuff.
      - The second one was to create all the views on the frontend to consume the API. I was part of a training group in which the first 2 months we learn the ruby programming language through exercises and programming challenges.
